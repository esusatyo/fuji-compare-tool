# Nikon Z third-party lenses — round 2 source log

Per-source log, written as each URL is read. T1 maker's own site (incl.
official regional sites) · T2 independent measurement/review · T3 retailer
(price/availability only) · T4 aggregator (tables only, never mount
attribution) · NEWS dated announcement (year only).

Record sources for facts you *rejected* too, with the reason — that's what
stops a later pass "correcting" a right value to a wrong one.

## Sigma+Tamron batch (2026-08-29, hand-merged — see PROGRESS.md)

- **T1** `https://www.tamron.com/global/consumer/lenses/a058/spec.html` —
  Nikon-Z-specific weight/length for `tamron-35-150mm-f2-28` (1,190g /
  160.1mm). Independently re-fetched by the orchestrator, confirmed exact
  match.
- **T1** `https://www.tamron.com/global/consumer/lenses/b070/spec.html` —
  Nikon-Z-specific weight/length for `tamron-17-70mm-f28` (540g / 121.3mm).
- **T1** `https://www.tamron.com/global/consumer/lenses/a067/spec.html` —
  Nikon-Z-specific weight/length for `tamron-50-400mm-f45-63` (1,180g /
  185.8mm).
- **T1** `https://www.tamron.com/global/consumer/lenses/a047/spec.html` —
  Nikon-Z-specific weight/length + magnification for
  `tamron-70-300mm-f45-63` (580g / 150.3mm / 0.20× max).
- **NEWS** `https://www.dpreview.com/news/8584835899/...` — `tamron-35-150mm-f2-28`
  Nikon-Z launch price $1,999 (2023-09-21). Blocked for WebFetch (bot-block);
  corroborated instead via WebSearch, which independently surfaced the same
  $1,999 figure plus confirmation that B&H's current list price is still
  $1,999 (Best Buy's $1,599 is a discount, not a new RRP — not used).
- **Rejected**: an untracked `scripts/price-overrides/nikon.json` found in
  the dead agent's worktree, listing CAD figures for
  `tamron-12-20mm-f28`/`tamron-35-100mm-f28`/`tamron-70-180mm-f28-g2`/
  `tamron-90mm-f28-macro` — none of these slugs exist in `nikon/data.js`.
  No source trail, no corresponding entry. Discarded as premature/stray
  content, not used.
- **T1** `sigma-global.com`'s Nikon Z mount filter — re-confirmed only the
  existing 3 DC DN primes (16/30/56mm) list Z; 18-50/10-18/23mm DC DN and all
  DG DN (full-frame) checked individually, none list Nikon Z.
- **T4** PetaPixel (2025-11-02) — corroborating-only mention that Nikon
  still blocks Sigma full-frame AF lenses from Z-mount.
